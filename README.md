# üéµ Spotify Playlist Downloader

A Python script that downloads music from YouTube based on tracks from Spotify playlists. This tool extracts track information from Spotify and searches for the corresponding audio on YouTube, then downloads it as MP3 files (when FFmpeg is available).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Authentication Support**: Works with both public playlists (no login required) and private playlists (requires Spotify login)
- **Smart Fallback System**: Automatically tries user authentication first, falls back to public access if needed
- **MP3 Conversion**: Automatically converts downloaded files to MP3 format when FFmpeg is available
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handles unavailable tracks, region restrictions, and API errors gracefully
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows detailed progress and download statistics
- **Debug Mode**: Includes diagnostic tools to troubleshoot playlist access issues
- **Respectful Downloads**: Includes delays between downloads to avoid overwhelming services

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **FFmpeg** (strongly recommended for MP3 conversion)

### Required Python Packages

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install spotipy yt-dlp
```

Or if you have a requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FFmpeg Installation

**FFmpeg is essential for converting downloaded audio files (usually WebM/MP4) to MP3 format.**

#### Windows:
1. Download FFmpeg from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract the files to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
3. Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH environment variable
4. Test installation: Open Command Prompt and run `ffmpeg -version`

#### macOS:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install ffmpeg

# Using MacPorts
port install ffmpeg
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### Linux (CentOS/RHEL):
```bash
sudo yum install ffmpeg
# or
sudo dnf install ffmpeg
```

### Verify FFmpeg Installation:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```
If FFmpeg is properly installed, you should see version information. If not, the script will still work but will download files in their original format (WebM/MP4) instead of converting to MP3.

## üîß Setup

### 1. Spotify API Credentials

You need to create a Spotify application to get API credentials:

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click "Create an App"
4. Fill in the app details:
   - **App Name**: Choose any name (e.g., "Playlist Downloader")
   - **App Description**: Brief description of your use
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
5. Accept the terms and create the app
6. Note down your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
7. Update the credentials in the script:

```python
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id_here'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret_here'
```

### 2. File Structure

Make sure your project directory looks like this:

```
Spotify Downloader/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ music_script.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ downloads/          # Created automatically
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .virtualEnv/        # Python virtual environment (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cache             # Spotify auth cache (created automatically)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python music_script.py
   ```

2. **Enter a Spotify playlist URL when prompted:**
   ```
   Enter Spotify playlist URL: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
   ```

3. **Authentication (if needed):**
   - For public playlists: No authentication required
   - For private playlists: A browser window will open for Spotify login
   - Complete the login process and return to the terminal

4. **Confirm download:**
   - The script will show how many tracks were found
   - Confirm if you want to proceed with the download

### Supported URL Formats

- Full playlist URL: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
- Playlist URL with parameters: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M?si=abcd1234`
- Just the playlist ID: `37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`

### Example Output

## üìÅ Output

### File Locations

- **Downloads folder**: `downloads/` (created automatically)
- **File format**: MP3 (if FFmpeg is available) or original format (WebM/MP4)
- **File names**: Based on YouTube video titles
- **Audio quality**: 192 kbps MP3 (when converted)

### Without FFmpeg
If FFmpeg is not installed, files will be downloaded in their original format:
- **.webm** files (most common)
- **.mp4** files (some videos)
- **.m4a** files (audio-only)

These files can be manually converted to MP3 later using FFmpeg:
```bash
ffmpeg -i "input_file.webm" -b:a 192k "output_file.mp3"
```

### With FFmpeg
When FFmpeg is available, all files are automatically converted to MP3 format with:
- **Codec**: MP3
- **Bitrate**: 192 kbps
- **Quality**: High quality audio suitable for most uses

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Playlist not found or not accessible"
- **Solution**: Check if the playlist URL is correct
- **Solution**: Ensure the playlist is public or you have access to it
- **Solution**: Try with user authentication (the script will prompt you)

#### "FFmpeg not found"
- **Solution**: Install FFmpeg (see installation instructions above)
- **Alternative**: Downloads will work but in original format (WebM/MP4)

#### "Authentication failed"
- **Solution**: Check your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret
- **Solution**: Ensure the redirect URI in your Spotify app settings matches: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
- **Solution**: Try deleting the `.cache` file and re-authenticating

#### "Failed to download" messages
- **Common causes**: Video not available, age-restricted content, geo-blocked content
- **Solution**: These are usually individual track issues and don't affect the overall download process

#### Downloads are slow
- The script includes intentional delays between downloads to be respectful to services
- This is normal behavior and helps avoid rate limiting

### Debug Mode

The script includes automatic debug mode that activates when playlist access fails:

```
Running diagnostic tests...
Test 1: Basic playlist access...
Test 2: Trying with market=US...
Test 3: Searching for playlist...
```

### Test Playlists

If you're having issues, try these known working public playlists:

- **Today's Top Hits**: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
- **RapCaviar**: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd`
- **Global Top 50**: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF`

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Download Settings

You can modify the `download_from_youtube` function to change:

- **Audio quality**: Change `'preferredquality': '192'` to desired bitrate
- **Output format**: Change `'audioformat': 'mp3'` to other formats
- **Output directory**: Change `output_folder='downloads'` to your preferred location

### Batch Processing

To process multiple playlists, you can modify the main section:

```python
playlists = [
    "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/playlist1",
    "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/playlist2",
]

for playlist in playlists:
    download_spotify_playlist(playlist)
```
